Advent of Code 2019
===================

I decided to use [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) as an opportunity to take a look at the Rust programming language.

Stats
-----

Just for fun, some runtime stats when executing the solutions on my machine (Intel i7-7500U @ 2.7GHz, Windows 10 Pro 64-bit). Times were taken with [Measure-Command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/measure-command?view=powershell-6), each solution was executed 100 times to determine minimum, maximum, and average runtime. No times available for day 25 since I "manually" played the text adventure.
